To use this function, you would need to define a function f(t, y) that represents the right-hand side of the differential equation you want to solve. You would also need to specify the initial time t0, the initial solution value y0, the final time t1, and the number of time steps n you want to take. The function will then return the time steps t and the corresponding solution values y as NumPy arrays.

For example, to solve the initial value problem y' = t * y, y(0) = 1 from t = 0 to t = 1 with n = 10 time steps, you could do the following:
'''

def f(t, y):
    return t * y

t, y = abm(f, 0, 1, 1, 10)

#This would compute the solution at 10 time steps from t = 0 to t = 1, and store the time steps and corresponding solution values in the arrays
