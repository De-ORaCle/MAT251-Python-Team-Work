    Approximate the definite integral of a function using a Maclaurin series expansion.

To use this function, you will need to import the math module. You can then call the maclaurin_integration function with a function func and the lower and upper bounds of the integration range a and b, as well as an optional parameter n specifying the number of terms to use in the Maclaurin series expansion.

For example, to approximate the integral of the function f(x) = x**2 from 0 to 2 using 50 terms in the Maclaurin series expansion, you could do:
'''

import math

def f(x):
    return x**2

result = maclaurin_integration(f, 0, 2, n=50)
print(result)
