'''
In this example, the function milne takes in the following inputs:

f: a function that represents the system of ODEs. It should take in two arguments: a time t and a solution vector y. It should return an array of the derivatives of y with respect to t.
t0: the initial time.
y0: an array containing the initial values of the solution vector.
h: the step size.
n: the number of steps to take.
The function milne returns an array containing the approximated solution at each time step. To use this function, you need to define a function f that represents the system of ODEs you want to solve, and then pass it along with the other inputs to milne.
